Steps to set up this app on your PC:-

S1) First of all make a fork of this repo for yourself. This means, do not start direct contributions.

S2) Then, clone your fork to your system.

S3) Open it in VS Code.

## Backend ##

S4) Right-click on the "backend" folder, and choose "open in integrated terminal"

S5) Now, you can go to that terminal. Also, check that it's the terminal with "backend" as the path.

S6) Run this command "npm i" to install the node modules folder (it's a heavy folder and hence is not uploaded to Git Hub, always is done like this only.)

S7) After this, run "npm run dev" in that backend terminal.

## Frontend ##

S8) Do the same for the "frontend" folder. Open it in a separate terminal using "open in integrated terminal" by right-clicking. Do "npm i" here also.

S9) After this, run "npm run start" in that frontend terminal. 

Now, smash your keyboards and rock on!
